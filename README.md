## Link: Keep and publish web links via HTML, RSS, and JSON

Welcome! Link is a demo application in use for RailsConf 2021 as part of the "[Deploying your Rails Application to Kubernetes](https://railsconf.com/program/workshops#session-1137)".

We'll use Link during the workshop to build a local Kubernetes environment and doing a three-step process for working with Kubernetes locally.

## Prerequisites

### Ruby and Rails

Link is a Rails application and requires Ruby 2.7.2. We use `rbenv` to run Ruby locally, but use whatever method you're comfortable with.

Link runs on Rails 6.1.3.1, the latest released version as of 2021-04-11.

NB: If you're running an older version of bundler, you will want to update that first: `gem install bundler`

### PostgreSQL

Link uses PostgreSQL as a relational database. Any recent version should work. Your local instance of PostgreSQL may or may not require a password. The default role for a local installation does not.

- I installed PostgreSQL through Homebrew: `brew install postgresql` on macOS
- Linux users should use their system's package manager
- Windows users can [download an interactive installer](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/)
- Be sure to start PostgreSQL before you attempt to start the app
    - For macOS users w/ Homebrew: `brew services start postgresql`

### Redis

Link uses [Redis](https://redis.io) to run Sidekiq. The app is not doing much with Sidekiq, but we wanted to demonstrate it running as a concern to be aware of with running a Rails app in Kubernetes. NB: We're using the open source version of Redis, not Redis Enterprise. Any major version 4 or greater should be fine.

- macOS: Recommended install via Homebrew `brew install redis`
- Linux users should use their system's package manager
    - Ubuntu users, [there's an official PPA](https://redis.io/download#from-the-official-ubuntu-ppa)
    - Redis is also [available as a snap](https://redis.io/download#from-snapcraft)
- Windows: This appears to involve setting up the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://redislabs.com/blog/redis-on-windows-10/)
    - Candidly, we're not Windows users, so unfortunately, we're not going to be much help here
- Be sure to start Redis
    - For macOS users w/ Homebrew: `brew services start redis`

## Setup

**For the RailsConf 2021 workshop, fork this repository, instead of cloning it.**

### tl;dr

- Fork the repository
- `bundle install`, `yarn install`
- Create a `.env` file and update it
- Create a `config/database.yml` file with the appropriate credentials and settings
- Create the databases and migrate them
- Fill-in seed data
- Start the app with Foreman
- Open the app

### Stepwise

- Fork the repository
    - Creating a fork seems momentous, yeah? Well, we'll be changing around `config/database.yml` and it's easier to commit changes if you're on your own version of the repo
- Within the repository, `bundle install` then `yarn install`
- Create a `.env` file
    - `cp .env.example .env`
- Edit `.env`
    - Rails port: Search and replace for `3000` with an available port. E.g. I use `4100`
    - Webpacker port: Search and replace for `3035` with an available port. I use `4135` for this
    - Adjust the `REDIS_URL` database number, if needed. The default is `15`
- Review `config/database.yml` file for appropriate settings
    - We left this as is, change it on your fork as necessary
- Create the database
    - Empty DB: `rails db:create`
        - `RAILS_ENV=test rails db:create`
    - Migrate: `rails db:migrate`
- Fill-in seed data
    - `rails db:seed`
- Handle _all_ of the database tasks in one go
    - `rails db:setup`
- Redo _all_ of the database tasks
    - `rails db:reset`
- Start the app with Foreman
    - `(bundle exec) foreman start`
- Open the app in your browser at the port you specified in `.env`
    - `http://localhost:3000/`

## Getting started with the app

- View the initial seed data on the page
- Create an account
- Create your own entries

## Other key endpoints

NB: These are both unprotected endpoints. In a production application, you would have both of these wrapped with routing protection to check users for authentication and authorization.

- `/sidekiq`: Async job runner. [Sidekiq](https://sidekiq.org) will handle email, asynchronous API calls, or anything else you don't want your users to wait for
    - NB: We aren't doing anything with Sidekiq in this workshop beyond standing it up to demonstrate that it's something you need to consider and can handle with Kubernetes
- `/admin`: Adminsitrative interface. It's [Administrate](https://github.com/thoughtbot/administrate)
    - In this case, it's an easy spot to page through all of the data

## Running tests

There's a small test suite. Run it with `rspec`
